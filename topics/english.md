Most developers don’t need to think about domain-driven development when starting new projects, and it would probably be a waste of time in most cases (unless, of course, you are working in Big Co. but then why would you be reading an article for beginner Go developers).

大多数开发人员在开始新项目时不需要考虑领域驱动开发，在大多数情况下，这可能是在浪费时间（当然，除非你在大公司工作，但那你为什么要读一篇针对 Go 初学者的文章）。

Given my 11+ years experience in Go, I have decided to push forward with a reboot, written in Go.
The goals of the reboot are:

- A complete rewrite from the ground up
- Backwards compatible so all existing plugins work
- Modern language
- Quality tests (this will improve maintenance and allow us to bug fix and add features with confidence)
- A brand new name

We will also launch it with some new features that were troublesome to get right in the old codebase. Including, but maybe not limited to...

The project is underway and I expect to be able to share more in March/April 2021. At that point, I think I'll make a new main branch in this repo (to keep the stars and credit for past contributors) and switch to the fresh codebase that way.

I want to send thanks to everybody who has contributed, and apologies to those who submitted PRs to BitBar that haven't been accepted. Your work and ideas are still helpful for the rewrite, and you'll get the credit for that.

鉴于我 11 年多的 Go 开发经验，我决定尽快用 Go 进行重写。
重启的目标是
- 从头开始彻底重写
- 向后兼容，现有的插件都能正常工作
- 现代化的语言
- 更好的测试（使系统易于维护，让我们能放心大胆地修复错误和添加新功能）
- 一个全新的名字

我们还将推出一些新的功能，这些功能在旧的代码库中是很麻烦的。包括，但也许不限于（此处省略）。

项目正在进行中，我预计在 2021 年 3/4 月能够分享更多的内容。届时，我想我会在这个 repo 里做一个新的 main 分支（你的 star 和提交丢不了），然后这样切换到新的代码库。

我要向每一个做出贡献的人表示感谢，向那些给 BitBar 提交 PR 但没有被接受的人表示歉意。你们的工作和想法对重写还是很有帮助的，你们会得到相应的荣誉。

My therapist told me that reading the news was causing my depression. So I've managed to completely avoid it for the past five years. I used to consume articles for four hours every day. I’d always read the New York Times front to back-everything except the sports section. But then the Times caused the Iraq war so I switched over to leftist websites. I always thought it was my obligation as a responsible citizen to pay attention to bad news. I guess I was looking for some sort of understanding. If only I could learn enough, then maybe I could help organize something. But all of it just sent me into utter despair. I began to look at other people as brainwashed. Every time I saw someone having kids—I’d get angry. Don’t they realize how uninhabitable the planet is going to be? Everyone thinks if we just make a few changes, we'll be fine. We won't be fine. The problem is systemic and there's no movement capable of ending capitalism in time to save the planet. But anyway, I'm trying not to obsess over this stuff anymore.

我的治疗师说看新闻是导致我抑郁的原因，所以过去五年我彻底戒掉了看新闻的习惯。以前我每天看四小时新闻，总是把《纽约时报》从头读到尾——除了体育版面以外的所有内容都看。但后来时报引发了伊拉克战争，我就转到了左派网站。 我一直认为关注坏新闻是作为负责任的公民的义务。我想我是在寻求某种理解吧。如果能了解足够多的信息，那或许我就能帮忙组织些什么。但一切只让我陷入了彻底的绝望。我开始看着别人都觉得是被洗脑了。一看到有人生小孩儿，我就会生气。难道他们没意识到地球会多么不适宜居住吗？所有人都以为，大家只用做一些改变，我们就能安然无恙了。其实不会的。问题是系统性的，没有及时终结资本主义的运动能力来拯救地球。但无论如何，我现在都尽量不去纠结这些东西了。

Obsess yourself with all the things that might happen in the future.

In Event Of Moon Disaster

倘若登月失败

Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in their sacrifice.

命运注定这两位登陆月球进行和平探险的人将在月球上安息。两位勇者——尼尔•阿姆斯特朗和埃德温•奥尔德林——知道返航无望，但也知道其牺牲将为人类带来希望。他们两人为追寻人类最高贵的探求真理的目标过程中倒下。

These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal: the search for truth and understanding. They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by their nation; they will be mourned by the people of the world; they will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown. In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man.

他们将被亲友哀悼，他们的国家哀悼、全世界人民哀悼，他们更会被敢于将自己的儿子送往未知境地的地球母亲所哀悼。他们的探险，鼓舞世人团结一心，他们的牺牲，让人类四海一家皆兄弟的情谊紧密相连。

In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood. Others will follow, and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.

在古代，人类会抬头观星并在星座中看到英雄。在现代，人类也会观星，但我们的英雄是活生生的血肉之躯。未来将有更多人追随其脚步上太空，他们一定会找到回家的路。人类的探索不会停步。他们是第一批，将在人们心中永生。

For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.

在今后的夜晚，每个人仰望明月的时候，都会想到那里的一个角落已经成为永远的人类世界。
