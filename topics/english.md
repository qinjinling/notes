Most developers don’t need to think about domain-driven development when starting new projects, and it would probably be a waste of time in most cases (unless, of course, you are working in Big Co. but then why would you be reading an article for beginner Go developers).

大多数开发人员在开始新项目时不需要考虑领域驱动开发，在大多数情况下，这可能是在浪费时间（当然，除非你在 Big Co.工作，但那你为什么要读一篇针对 Go 初学者的文章）。

Given my 11+ years experience in Go, I have decided to push forward with a reboot, written in Go.
The goals of the reboot are:

- A complete rewrite from the ground up
- Backwards compatible so all existing plugins work
- Modern language
- Quality tests (this will improve maintenance and allow us to bug fix and add features with confidence)
- A brand new name

We will also launch it with some new features that were troublesome to get right in the old codebase. Including, but maybe not limited to...

The project is underway and I expect to be able to share more in March/April 2021. At that point, I think I'll make a new main branch in this repo (to keep the stars and credit for past contributors) and switch to the fresh codebase that way.

I want to send thanks to everybody who has contributed, and apologies to those who submitted PRs to BitBar that haven't been accepted. Your work and ideas are still helpful for the rewrite, and you'll get the credit for that.

鉴于我 11 年多的 Go 开发经验，我决定尽快用 Go 进行重写。
重启的目标是
- 从头开始彻底重写
- 向后兼容，现有的插件都能正常工作
- 现代化的语言
- 更好的测试（使系统易于维护，让我们能放心大胆地修复错误和添加新功能）
- 一个全新的名字

我们还将推出一些新的功能，这些功能在旧的代码库中是很麻烦的。包括，但也许不限于（此处省略）。

项目正在进行中，我预计在 2021 年 3/4 月能够分享更多的内容。届时，我想我会在这个 repo 里做一个新的 main 分支（你的 star 和提交丢不了），然后这样切换到新的代码库。

我要向每一个做出贡献的人表示感谢，向那些给 BitBar 提交 PR 但没有被接受的人表示歉意。你们的工作和想法对重写还是很有帮助的，你们会得到相应的荣誉。
