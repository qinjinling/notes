Most developers don’t need to think about domain-driven development when starting new projects, and it would probably be a waste of time in most cases (unless, of course, you are working in Big Co. but then why would you be reading an article for beginner Go developers).

大多数开发人员在开始新项目时不需要考虑领域驱动开发，在大多数情况下，这可能是在浪费时间（当然，除非你在大公司工作，但那你为什么要读一篇针对 Go 初学者的文章）。

Given my 11+ years experience in Go, I have decided to push forward with a reboot, written in Go.
The goals of the reboot are:

- A complete rewrite from the ground up
- Backwards compatible so all existing plugins work
- Modern language
- Quality tests (this will improve maintenance and allow us to bug fix and add features with confidence)
- A brand new name

We will also launch it with some new features that were troublesome to get right in the old codebase. Including, but maybe not limited to...

The project is underway and I expect to be able to share more in March/April 2021. At that point, I think I'll make a new main branch in this repo (to keep the stars and credit for past contributors) and switch to the fresh codebase that way.

I want to send thanks to everybody who has contributed, and apologies to those who submitted PRs to BitBar that haven't been accepted. Your work and ideas are still helpful for the rewrite, and you'll get the credit for that.

鉴于我 11 年多的 Go 开发经验，我决定尽快用 Go 进行重写。
重启的目标是
- 从头开始彻底重写
- 向后兼容，现有的插件都能正常工作
- 现代化的语言
- 更好的测试（使系统易于维护，让我们能放心大胆地修复错误和添加新功能）
- 一个全新的名字

我们还将推出一些新的功能，这些功能在旧的代码库中是很麻烦的。包括，但也许不限于（此处省略）。

项目正在进行中，我预计在 2021 年 3/4 月能够分享更多的内容。届时，我想我会在这个 repo 里做一个新的 main 分支（你的 star 和提交丢不了），然后这样切换到新的代码库。

我要向每一个做出贡献的人表示感谢，向那些给 BitBar 提交 PR 但没有被接受的人表示歉意。你们的工作和想法对重写还是很有帮助的，你们会得到相应的荣誉。

My therapist told me that reading the news was causing my depression. So I've managed to completely avoid it for the past five years. I used to consume articles for four hours every day. I’d always read the New York Times front to back-everything except the sports section. But then the Times caused the Iraq war so I switched over to leftist websites. I always thought it was my obligation as a responsible citizen to pay attention to bad news. I guess I was looking for some sort of understanding. If only I could learn enough, then maybe I could help organize something. But all of it just sent me into utter despair. I began to look at other people as brainwashed. Every time I saw someone having kids—I’d get angry. Don’t they realize how uninhabitable the planet is going to be? Everyone thinks if we just make a few changes, we'll be fine. We won't be fine. The problem is systemic and there's no movement capable of ending capitalism in time to save the planet. But anyway, I'm trying not to obsess over this stuff anymore.

我的治疗师说看新闻是导致我抑郁的原因，所以过去五年我彻底戒掉了看新闻的习惯。以前我每天看四小时新闻，总是把《纽约时报》从头读到尾——除了体育版面以外的所有内容都看。但后来时报引发了伊拉克战争，我就转到了左派网站。 我一直认为关注坏新闻是作为负责任的公民的义务。我想我是在寻求某种理解吧。如果能了解足够多的信息，那或许我就能帮忙组织些什么。但一切只让我陷入了彻底的绝望。我开始看着别人都觉得是被洗脑了。一看到有人生小孩儿，我就会生气。难道他们没意识到地球会多么不适宜居住吗？所有人都以为，大家只用做一些改变，我们就能安然无恙了。其实不会的。问题是系统性的，没有及时终结资本主义的运动能力来拯救地球。但无论如何，我现在都尽量不去纠结这些东西了。

Obsess yourself with all the things that might happen in the future.
