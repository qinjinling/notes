# Remote

A project can have multiple remotes ex. origin, test, production...

```bash
# Add a remote i.e. bookmark a repo i.e. This NAME = this URL. The name is usually "origin", but it can be anything.
git remote add NAME URL

# List all remotes.
git remote -v

# Check a remote.
git remote show origin

# Remove a remote.
git remote rm NAME
```
